# Team Semester Project

This class strives to encourage learning by doing and making a real difference in the practice of building software. To turn this spirit into reality, you will work on a semester-long project with an open source software project. A group of three to four students will select a unique open source software project and contribute security-related improvements.

The project will have the following deliverables:

1. **Project Proposal**: 2-3 page markdown document that describes the following:
  * What are the security needs of users from this software in its intended threat environment (e.g., home, office, enterprise, bank, government, etc.)? If there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your selection.
  * Develop a list of security features in the software. Again, if there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your choice.
  * Motivation for selecting this project
  * Open source project description (What is it?, Contributors, Activity, Use, Popularity, Languages used, platform, documentation sources, etc.)
  * [Discuss License, procedures for making contributions, and contributor agreements](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#orienting-yourself-to-a-new-project)
  * Summary of security-related history (E.g., known vulnerabilities, security-related engineering decisions, security feature additions/removal, etc. )
  * Link to your team GitHub repository that shows your internal project task assignments and collaborations to finish this task.
     - [Github Project Boards](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/)
     - [Kanban boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board)
1. **Requirements for Software Security Engineering**: A markdown report that describes the following:
  * Identify five essential data flows through the software and describe them using use-cases diagrams.
  * Derive security requirements for use cases using misuse case diagrams.
  * Assess alignment of security requirements with advertised features. Review OSS project documentation and codebase to support your observations.
  * Review OSS project documentation for security-related configuration and installation issues. Summarize your observations.
  * Link to your team GitHub repository that shows your internal project task assignments and collaborations to finish this task.
1. **Assurance Cases Software Security Engineering**: A markdown report that includes the following:
  * Using security requirements, identify five assurance claims
  * Prepare a convincing argument in support of the claims. Document this argument using an assurance case for each of the claims.
  * Collect evidence as required from the OSS project.
  * Link to your team GitHub repository that shows your internal project task assignments and collaborations to finish this task.
1. **Designing for Software Security Engineering**: A markdown report that describes the following:
  * Develop threat models for critical data-flows through the software. Misuse and assurance cases will provide starting points for examination. Include threat model diagrams.
  * Using threat model analysis, review OSS project for design related issues. Summarize your observations.
  * Link to your team GitHub repository that shows your internal project task assignments and collaborations to finish this task.
1. **Code analysis for Software Security Engineering**: A markdown report that describes the following:
  * Code review strategy
  * Findings from manual code review of critical security functions identified in misuse cases, assurance cases and threat models.
  * Findings from automated code scanning (if available). Include links to full reports.
  * Summary of key findings from manual and/or automated scanning. This summary may include categorization, mappings to CWEs, CAPECs, Risk Levels, etc.
  * Links to any pull requests, issues, discussion, etc. from the team to the original project and any follow-up interactions.
  * Link to your team GitHub repository that shows your internal project task assignments and collaborations to finish this task.
1. **Class Presentation**: 10-minute class presentation that highlights the following:
  * Project description
  * Gaps in security requirements and design of the original project
  * Assurance claims
  * Findings from manual code review and automated software scanning
  * Any contributions to the original project (documentation, design changes, code changes, communications)

## Project Hall of Fame

## Project Inspiration
* [Github guide for contributing to Open Source Projects](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute)
* [Openhub](https://www.openhub.net) by Black Duck Software
* Github [search](https://github.com/search) and [trends](https://github.com/trending).
* DHS SWAMP listing for [public software packages](https://www.mir-swamp.org/#packages/public).
* [Code Triage](https://www.codetriage.com)
* Some blogs to consider. [blog 1](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/getting-involved-open-source-projects), [blog 2](https://help.github.com/articles/where-can-i-find-open-source-projects-to-work-on/), [blog 3](http://www.firsttimersonly.com)

## Projects to Avoid
* In-active projects (no recent contributions, no activity on forums, lack of wiki or documentation)
* Old vulnerable project versions
* Mobile Apps
* Projects with languages that do not have a lot of tool support
* Project with little or no security requirements. As surprising as it may sound, not all software has security needs!
* Projects not accepting contributions
